Discussion and
Analysis
Overview of the Industry
Global GDP in FY 2023 was affected by the Russia-
Ukraine war
and resultant dislocations in supply chains, leading
to surging
food and energy inflation. Central banks raised
interest rates
sharply in response. As a result, the global GDP is
estimated to
have grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus
5.9% in the
prior year1.
Global technology spending on Enterprise software and
IT
services crossed the $2 trillion2 mark in 2022,
growing 5.5% YoY.
IT services grew 3.5% YoY, to $1,250 billion. This
growth was led
by accelerated cloud adoption, preference for
external expertise
due to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of
digital
transformation to cover more back-office operational
areas.
The global IT services industry continues to be a
highly
fragmented one, with even the largest provider having
a mid-
single digit market share. TCS is among the largest
IT services
providers globally, with a market share of 2.2%, and
has
outperformed the market, growing significantly higher
than
market growth over the last decade.

The outperformance may be attributed to market share

resulting from TCS’ longer-term, purpose-driven
partnerships
with its customers, its agile organization structure,
and a very
stable management team; its investments in organic
talent
development, research and innovation, intellectual

TCS’ Business
An Overview
TCS is an IT services, consulting and business
solutions
organization partnering many of the world’s largest
businesses
in their transformational journeys for the last 55
years. It has
a global presence, deep domain expertise in multiple
industry
verticals and a complete portfolio of offerings –
grouped under
consulting and service integration, application
services, digital
transformation services, cloud services, engineering
services,
cognitive business operations, and products and
platforms –
targeting every C-suite stakeholder.
The company leverages all these capabilities and its
deep
contextual knowledge of its customers’ businesses to
craft
unique, high quality, high impact solutions designed
to deliver
differentiated business outcomes. These solutions are
delivered
using its Secure Borderless Workspaces™ (SBWS™)
operating
model which enables a highly distributed, Location
Independent
Agile™ delivery.
TCS geographic footprint covers North America, Latin
America,
the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific,
India and
Middle-East Africa.
TCS considers industry verticals as its primary go-
to-market
business segments. The key vertical clusters are:
Banking,
Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI),
Communication, Media
and Technology (CMT), Retail and Consumer Business,
Life
Sciences and Healthcare, Manufacturing and Others.
Strategy for Sustainable Growth3
Customer-centricity is at the heart of TCS’ strategy,
organization structure and investment decisions. TCS’
customer-centric worldview helps spot trends early,
embrace
business opportunities by making the right
investments and
mitigating risks while discharging its social and
environmental
responsibilities.
TCS has been broadening and deepening customer
relationships
by continually looking for new opportunities and
newer areas in
their businesses to add value, proactively investing
in building
newer capabilities, reskilling its workforce and
launching newer
services, solutions, products and platforms to
address those
opportunities.
In the last few years, the company has been using its
investments in research and innovation, its
intellectual property
and deep contextual knowledge of the customer’s
business
and technology landscape to proactively pitch ideas
and
solutions designed to improve the client’s topline
and help drive
competitive differentiation.
These growth and transformation (G&T) engagements are
higher value engagements catering to the needs of a
broader
set of stakeholders in the client organization,
enjoying greater
visibility within the CXO suite and more closely
aligned with
their business strategy. An expanding share of this
business is
helping drive a steady increase in the scope and
scale of services
consumed year after year, and an expansion of TCS’
share of
wallet, as evidenced by the client metrics.
Over time, this strategy has resulted in deep and
enduring
customer relationships, a vibrant and engaged
workforce,
industry-leading profitability, a steady expansion of
the
addressable market, and a proven track record in
delivering
longer term stakeholder value.
Enabling Investments
TCS pioneered4 the use of the word ‘digital’ to
describe the
new family of technologies that emerged in the last
decade.
Quick to recognize the potential of cloud, the
company made
investments ahead of time in launching new platform-
based
business models as far back as in 20095, reskilling
the workforce,
research and innovation, building collaborative
workspaces
and innovation centers, intellectual property, and
alliances and
partnerships. Those early investments have given TCS
a head
start in participating in its customers’ G&T
journeys.
The company continues to invest in co-innovation
hubs,
launching TCS Pace Ports™ in major markets. TCS teams
use
these physical spaces to work with academic and
start-up
partners, ideate jointly with client teams and
rapidly build
prototypes. The Pace Ports at Pittsburgh in the US,
in the
Carnegie Mellon University campus, and the other in
Toronto,
Canada, were formally inaugurated this year.
Including the ones
in Tokyo, New York and Amsterdam, the company has
five Pace
Ports in all.
The company launched joint innovation hubs as well,
using
the TCS Pace™ framework. TCS and Boots launched an
agile
incubator called INNOVATE Powered by TCS Pace™, at
Boots’
Nottingham headquarters in the UK. TCS forged a major
applied
engineering and research partnership with The
National
Robotarium, UK’s largest and most advanced AI and
robotics
research centre, located at Heriot-Watt University’s
Edinburgh
campus.
TCS continued to expand and deepen its industry-
leading
portfolio of products and platforms, launching new
variants
within the ignio™ suite and building newer
functionality and
features in the TCS BaNCS™ suite, HOBS, TwinX,
Mastercraft
and Jile. TCS Omnistore™ now offers three more
modules
as part of its AI powered enterprise personalization
- Unified
and composable commerce, Enterprise personalization,
and
Marketing hub.
TCS’ dedicated practice units around AWS, Microsoft
Azure
and Google Cloud Platform have been steadily
investing in
training, certifications, credentials and in building
solutions and
intellectual property on their respective hyperscaler
stacks.
In FY 2023, the company crossed the milestone of
100,000
hyperscaler-certified employees. By virtue of being
one of their
largest system integrator partners with deep domain
expertise
across multiple areas, TCS was the launch partner for
many new
solutions introduced by hyperscaler platforms during
the year.
The company has leveraged its deep domain knowledge
across
multiple industries to create an extensive catalog of
over 100
industry cloud offerings addressing the needs of
clients across
20 industries. The portfolio of TCS solutions
available on public
hyperscaler cloud platforms continued to expand. In
FY 2023,
TCS Dexam™, TCS DigiGov™, TCS Cognitive Plant
Operations, TCS
Mobility Cloud Suite and TCS ESG Integrator were
added to the
list of existing solutions like TCS Omnistore™, TCS
MasterCraft™,
5G Edge Suite, TwinX, TCS Clever Energy™, TCS IP2™
and TCS
Envirozone™.

Talent Management
TCS aims to attract, develop, motivate and retain
diverse talent,
that is critical for its competitive differentiation
and continued
success. The company’s talent management strategy
seeks
to maximize the potential of every employee by
creating a
purpose-driven, inclusive, stimulating, and rewarding
work
environment, delivering outstanding employee
experience,
while fueling business growth. TCS strives to create
a vibrant
workplace and an engaged workforce by encouraging
four
behaviors: follow your passion, stay hungry, commit
to lifelong
learning and thrive together.
In FY 2023, TCS made a net addition of 22,600
employees
globally, taking the total employee base to 614,795,
representing
150 nationalities.
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
After two years of remote working, TCS initiated a
Return
to Office initiative to better integrate and
acculturate new
recruits, deepen employee engagement levels, drive
purposeful
engagement and extend the spirit of #OneTCS. As an
outcome,
50% of employees started working from office for two
or more
days in a week.
Industry-First Initiatives
Intensified focus on equipping the company’s mid-
level
•
managers with market relevant skills by providing the
right learning and certification opportunities to
help them

platform for employees, to capture employees’
aspirations
and mapping them to future opportunities. Aspirations
of nearly 2/3rd of TCSers were captured, with ~100K

Talent Acquisition
In FY 2023, TCS responded with agility to the
changing supply
side dynamics which saw the unprecedented industry-
wide
employee churn peaking mid-year, then falling sharply
in
the latter half. This entailed recalibrating talent
acquisition
dynamically to fully utilize the additional capacity
built up in the
prior year.
The company remains the preferred employer and one of
the
largest job creators in IT services in several major
markets, for
both freshers and lateral hires. In addition to about
44,000 fresh
engineers, TCS onboarded its highest ever number of
lateral
recruits during the year. It also pivoted from a
virtual-only
mode to a hybrid model of virtual and in-person
recruitment
focused on attracting the right talent, creating
better employee
experiences, and building the TCS brand.
Key Achievements:
•

to market relevant learning opportunities for career
growth and
no TCSer should be left behind. The company has
adopted a
segmented approach to learning to ensure this.
TCS Elevate: TCS’ pioneering program linking learning
to career
growth and reward covered over 407,000 employees.
Over
22,000 employees were identified as high talent and
received
increased compensation.
Contextual Masters: TCS’ program to identify tenured

entirely virtual
working, the company adopted an increasingly phygital
(physical + digital) approach to learning and
development.

during the year.
Building on Belief through Purposeful People Policies
Based on feedback received from employees, evolving
needs of
the workforce and best practices in the field of
human capital
management, the company makes refinements to existing
policies and introduces new policy. In FY 2023, TCS:

keeping
with its talent cloud strategy, that encourages
employees
to take ownership of their careers by seeking new and
challenging opportunities at defined periodicity.

which
provides necessary support and flexibility for
caregivers of
young children, expectant women employees, and
persons
with disability.
•Extended its policy on DEI to include gender
identity,
individuals with mental variations and HIV/Aids
affected
persons at the workplace, and to comply with relevant
inclusivity laws.
Talent Transformation
TCS has multiple initiatives to help employees grow
in their
careers:
•Mentoring: TCS has been building a culture of
mentoring
and coaching in the organization through systemic
intervention programs as part of its Mentor
Capability
Building Framework. This was further strengthened
during
the year with the introduction of two new
certifications
– Platinum and NexGen certification in mentoring. TCS
currently has about 36,000 mentors in the
organization of
whom more than 3,500 Gold and Silver certified.

mobility. This embodies the company’s philosophy of
giving the first right of refusal for all leadership
positions
to internal candidates, thereby enabling better
leadership
development and building strong organizational
loyalty.
Competitive Compensation
TCS’ business model depends on its ability to attract
and
retain talent in the highly competitive, global
market for
software engineers with graduate or post-graduate
degrees in
engineering and with relevant technical skills.
Compensation levels are merit based, determined by
qualification, experience levels, special skills if
any, and
individual performance. Compensation structures are
driven
by prevailing practices in each country that TCS
operates in.
The merit based, democratized, transparent talent
framework
– Elevate, is designed to establish a tighter linkage
between
learning, skill development, career and reward. The
company
regularly benchmarks its compensation plans and
benefits with
the market to ensure competitiveness.
At TCS, three months’ notice is required from either
side for
termination6. Although most of the organization’s
activities
are performed by full-time employees, TCS uses
contractors,
especially for short-term assignments or those
requiring skills
not internally available.
Engagement with Purpose
With more employees returning to work, various
programs
were run to enable higher levels of engagement. More
than
320,000 employees were engaged through townhalls and
project confluences with an emphasis on Living my
Values,
Build my Career and Lifelong Learning. The company
enabled
more than 22,000 mentoring sessions and over 15,000

Employee Retention
TCS’ values-driven culture, progressive HR policies,
and
philosophy of investing in people and empowering them
have
been integral to creating a culture of belonging and
One TCS and
also made it an industry benchmark in talent
retention.
The company’s philosophy of grooming leadership from
within,
and giving first right of refusal to internal talent
for new open
positions, inspires higher levels of loyalty to the
organization.
This has resulted in a very strong, deeply
acculturated mid-layer
with long tenures in the company. This cohort played
a pivotal
role in seamlessly integrating new talent in FY 2023
and added
significant value through their contributions and
contextual
knowledge.
Unprecedented levels of employee churn across the
industry
drove TCS’ attrition to an all-time high in the first
half of FY 2023.
It trended down in the second half. IT services
attrition was
20.1% on an LTM basis.
Occupational Health and Safety
TCS has a well-defined Occupational Health and Safety
(OHS)
policy and supporting processes to ensure the safety
and
well-being of its employees. Safety lead and lag
indicators
are measured across the organization and reported.
The
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee in the Board
reviews the
company’s health and safety performance on a half-
yearly basis.
Over 94% of the workforce is represented in joint
management-
employee health and safety committees that monitor,
advise,
and drive occupational, health and safety
initiatives.
TCS is certified to ISO 45001:2018 Occupational
Health and
Safety Management System standard across 127 of its
facilities
worldwide covering approximately 94% of its total
footprint.
The company continued to focus on creating ergonomic
awareness including correct postures and workstation
stretches
for an office-based work environment and remote
working
environment, as employees worked in hybrid mode
during the
year. General safety awareness (fire safety, office
safety, road
safety etc.,) and safety incident reporting awareness
was also
provided to employees through monthly themes and
campaign
initiatives. There were also several fitness
programs, including
yoga and meditation practices, mental health and
wellbeing
which drew employee participation.

Business Outlook
Global growth is projected to moderate from 3.4
percent in
2022 to 2.8 percent in 20238 , weighed down by
central banks
raising interest rates to fight inflation, and
Russia’s war in
Ukraine. In major economies, the heightened risk of a
recession
– made worse by a banking crisis – has led to
uncertainty in
enterprise decision-making, affecting spending on
capex and
certain discretionary programs.
Despite this, spending on IT services has been
resilient so far.
Cloud migration programs are continuing apace, and
clients
continue to launch new G&T projects. The higher level
of
uncertainty in the business environment has made
clients
more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and
business
operating model transformations that can not only
deliver
significant efficiencies but also help them become
more agile
and resilient. All this has resulted in a strong

FY 2023, at $34.1 Bn, which is 1.2 times revenue. The

This provides visibility on medium-term growth amid
near-
term uncertainty. If the delayed decision-making and
cash
conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY
2023
flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could
result in some
moderation in full year revenue growth after two
years of strong
growth.
Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s
growth in
FY 2024 include:
•
Technology transformation: IT infrastructure
modernization, cloud enablement, application and data
estate modernization, cloud migration, data centre

collocated data support, digital workplace, digital

Enterprise Risk Management9
FY 2023 saw multiple external and internal challenges
continuing
to shape the overall risk profile of the company.
Macroeconomic
and geo-political risks had an impact throughout the
year.
The Russia-Ukraine war and geo-political tensions,
trade wars
and imposed sanctions were pervasive and had direct
and
cascading impacts on economies and businesses.
Shortages,
rising inflation, supply-chain disruptions, energy
crisis led to
further uncertainties in the economic growth
environment,
with the year ending with banking industry upheavals
in US and
Europe. During the year, IT organizations including
TCS faced the
TCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic
business
environment very closely and has strengthened the
deployment
of its Enterprise Risk Management framework to
address
the risks and leverage the associated opportunities.
This
framework enables risk identification, risk
assessment, risk
response planning and actions, risk monitoring and
overall risk
governance. Key risk indicators and control
indicators are used
to anticipate risks and assess effectiveness of their
mitigation
actions respectively.
TCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk
profile, covering
strategic, operational, compliance, financial and
catastrophic
risks, thus enabling informed decision-making. Risks
are
assessed and managed at various levels with a top-
down and
bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business
units,
geographies, business functions, customer
relationships and
individual projects.
Listed below are some of the key risks, anticipated
impact on the company and mitigation strategies.

quantum computing, generative AI and
large language models and metaverse could
•
impact TCS’ business:Ensure controlled use of these
technologies
through pilots/research.
•
Quantum computing may increase
exposure to cyberattacks because
existing security infrastructure may
prove inadequate.
Work with government bodies, regulators and
academia to build consensus about policies and
guidelines for use of these technologies.
•Embark on large-scale skilling of employees to
prepare for deployment on market-oriented
products and services based on these
technologies.
Generative AI, large language models
and metaverse could lead to legal
liabilities through plagiarism, deep
fakes and privacy and copyright
infringement issues.
•The efficacy of AI models depends on •
the quality of the data they are trained
on. Unless specifically designed to
prevent such outcomes, the models
could be vitiated by all kinds of
human biases contained in large data
sets, and produce outcomes that
cause reputational damage and legal
liabilities.
Generative AI technologies could
disrupt software development and
testing activities, distorting customer
expectations in the short term.

Management Discussion and Analysis | 104
TCS has aligned its current systems of internal
financial control
with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, on the
lines
of the globally accepted risk-based framework issued
by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the
Treadway
Commission. The Internal Control – Integrated
Framework
(the 2013 framework) is intended to increase
transparency
and accountability in an organization’s process of
designing
and implementing a system of internal control. The
framework
requires a company to identify and analyze risks and
manage
appropriate responses. The company has successfully
laid down
the framework and ensured its effectiveness.
TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size
and the
nature of its operations. These have been designed to
provide
reasonable assurance with regard to recording and
providing
reliable financial and operational information,
complying with
applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from
unauthorized use,
executing transactions with proper authorization and
ensuring
compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-
defined
delegation of power with authority limits for
approving contracts
as well as expenditure. Processes for formulating and
reviewing
annual and long-term business plans have been laid
down.
TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource
planning (ERP)
system that connects all parts of the organization,
to record data
for accounting, consolidation and management
information
purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all
its processes
and controls with global best practices.
TCS management assessed the effectiveness of the
company’s
internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Regulation
17 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements)
Regulations, 2015 (SEBI LODR) as of March 31, 2023.
Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
B S R & Co. LLP, the statutory auditors of TCS have
audited the
financial statements included in this annual report
and have
issued an attestation report on the company’s
internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in section 143
of Companies
Act, 2013).
TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP
(PwC)
LLP to oversee and carry out internal audit of its
activities. The
audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is
reviewed each
year in consultation with the statutory auditors and
approved
by the Audit Committee. In line with international
practice,
the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the
review of
internal controls and risks in the company’s
operations such
as software delivery, accounting and finance,
procurement,
employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes,
including
the subsidiaries and foreign branches.
TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized
third party
consultants and professionals for business specific
compliances
such as quality management, service management,
information
security, etc. The Audit Committee reviews reports
submitted
by the management and audit reports submitted by
internal
auditors and statutory auditors. Suggestions for
improvement
are considered and the audit committee follows up on
corrective
action. The audit committee also meets TCS’ statutory
auditors
to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy
of internal
control systems and keeps the board of directors
informed of its
major observations periodically.
Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of
Companies
Act 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR), TCS’ Audit
Committee
has concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, the
company’s
internal financial controls were adequate and
operating
effectively.
