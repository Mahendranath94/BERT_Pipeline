Dear Stakeholder,
Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience
even as other parts of the technology universe
deflated,
and macroeconomic uncertainties worsened in our major

year
(13.7% in constant currency).
This growth came with an industry leading operating
margin of
24.1%. Our Net Margin was at 18.7%. The Earnings Per
Share
was at ₹115.19, a growth of 11.2% over the prior year.
From an industry vertical perspective, growth in FY
2023
was led by Retail and Consumer Business, which grew
22.1%, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 20.2%
and
Communications, Media and Technology which grew

Innovate, Adapt, Thrive
Our performance this year reflects how much of an
enterprise
staple IT services have become. Our full services
capability
enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times
and bad.
During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and
expand
their technology-led innovation to differentiate
themselves and
drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt,
using

technology o drive the efficiency, agility and
resilience needed
to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for
better times
ahead.
Cloud transformation remained a high priority area
for
enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on
execution. They
engaged us to take up the modernization and migration
of
their bigger, more complex workloads. The breadth and
depth
of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain
knowledge,
strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers
and our
portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give
us a distinct
competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption
cycle.
We also helped clients cope with the challenge of
managing
cloud expenses. In some cases, it required
rearchitecting
their application stack to be more cloud native,
capable of
dynamically ramping up resource consumption during
periods
of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other
times.
Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud
managed
services to rein in cloud costs.
The adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive
innovation within enterprises. The availability of
compute, dataand networks at scale provides access to
powerful technologies
like advanced analytics and machine learning, applied
to diverse
areas like computer vision, text and speech
processing, in
domains like dynamic supply chain optimization, new
molecule
discovery in life sciences and usage-based pricing of
insurance
coverage.
Newer developments like generative AI, large language
models,
and quantum computing triggered more experimentation
and
innovation by our clients. Our investments in
research and
innovation across different industries, and our Pace
innovation
architecture have positioned us well to partner with
them in
these initiatives. Our Agile Innovation Cloud
offering, where
we create dedicated, location-independent innovation
teams
to help clients accelerate and scale up their
innovation, gained
further traction in FY 2023. 7 new clients signed up
during the
year, bringing the total to 30 clients.
Newer developments like generative
AI, large language models, and

experimentation and innovation
by our clients. Our investments in
research and innovation across
different industries, and our Pace
innovation architecture have
positioned us well to partner with

Some of the emerging innovation themes that we helped
customers with include ecosystem and multi-industry
models
underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces,
API and
blockchain, in industries like transportation and
public sector;
AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics
industry, and
new applications for digital twins in the BFSI,
Telecom and Retail
industries.Applied at scale, across a broad set of
business or IT
operations, this can result in an entirely new
operating
model that significantly boosts our clients’
competitiveness.
As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second
half
of the year, we saw clients adapting by
reprioritizing their
spends and showing greater interest in such operating
model
transformations.
Within our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio,
business
model innovation continued to be a key theme. For
example,
for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we
built the service
delivery platform central to their new business model
of
providing warranty repair, refurbishment and
replacement
services of various home appliances to households.TCS
Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration
suite,
has been a game changer, enabling faster
transformations
that deliver concrete business benefits within
months. Its 600
pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions
enable plug
and play transformation of a range of business and
technology
functions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our
clients have
used it to transform their business and IT
operations.
Ingram Micro, one of the largest technology
distributors in
the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot
into
e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform
from
a traditional distributor to a platform company that
does
distribution. Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based
house
of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as
Coach, Kate
Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive
their
omnichannel modernization and transform the customer
journey experience.
Other G&T themes, such as M&A and sustainability
continued to
bring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic
engagements
for us in FY 2023. Elsewhere in this report, you can
read about
the work we did for Philips Domestic Appliances in
its journey
to be a standalone company, and how we helped
Eversource
Energy pursue its carbon neutrality aspirations.
Digital transformation, which began in the front
office, towards
enhancing customer experience, made further inroads
within
the enterprise during the year, unlocking tremendous
value
in the middle and back office. As critical
technologies such as
machine vision and conversational systems get better
with
the use of AI, our Machine First™ approach is helping
clients
use them innovatively in the back office, embedding
them
into reimagined processes to drive greater velocity,
agility,
throughput and resilience – which, among other
things, also
enhances customer experience.
In traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-
services
integrated deals. By consolidating multiple elements
of the
operation stack – processes, applications, and the
underlying
technology and infrastructure – with a single
strategic partner,
clients not only achieve greater accountability, but
also reduce
complexity and derisk their larger business
transformations. The
same rationale is driving more vendor consolidation
initiatives
that favor a few strategic partners with end-to-end
service
offerings, the right innovation capabilities and
scale.
All these trends play to our strengths. Our scale,
structure, and
ability to bring together different capabilities into
a seamless
service delivery team, helped us win several large
deals
throughout the year.
Investing in People
The supplyside challenges of the last two years
peaked in
the first half of FY 2023, with employee churn
reaching
unprecedented levels. We broke out of the vicious
cycle of hiring
and counter-hiring within the industry by investing
in onboarding
an unprecedent number of fresh engineers – over
110,000 in
FY 2022 and over 44,000 in FY 2023 – and training
them on the
technologies most in demand.In FY 2023, we focused on
utilizing the spare capacity built up in
the prior year, and recalibrated our hiring
especially as attrition
started falling in the second half of the year. Our
LTM attrition in
IT services for the year was 20.1%. Net addition in
FY 2023 was
22,600, and the closing headcount was 614,795. Our
workforce
continued to be very diverse, with over 150
nationalities
represented and with women making up 35.7% of the
employee
base.
Our investments in organic talent development
continue to
deliver exceptional outcomes. In FY 2023, TCSers
logged
48.3 million learning hours, and acquired nearly 6
million
competencies. Popular technologies witnessed
unprecedented
levels of interest from our employees. During the
year, 53,000
TCSers acquired certification on hyperscaler cloud
skills, bringing
the total number to over 110,000, making TCS one of
the Top 2
partners to the largest cloud providers.
Caring for Communities
We continued to work with communities across the
world,
pursuing our long-standing commitment to programs in
the
areas of skills development, bridging of digital
divides and
STEM education. In FY 2023, we estimate that our
community
initiatives touched the lives of over 4.5 million
beneficiaries –
women, youth and members of marginalized communities.
Our large programs in India around literacy, digital
entrepreneurship and youth skilling continued to gain
scale.
Likewise, our STEM initiatives outside India. goIT is
shaping
the next generation of digital innovators in 42
countries, while
Ignite my Future in School program has doubled its
original
goal, serving over 2 million students and educators
in five
geographies worldwide since inception in 2017.
So long, farewell
This year marks a key milestone in my journey with
TCS, and
an important transition point for the company, as I
step down
from my role as CEO and MD on 31st May 2023. It has
been an
absolute privilege and an unparalleled learning
experience to
lead our company in the last six years, a period of
tremendous
growth and transformation for us.
On a more personal note, I am grateful to Chandra,
our
Chairman, for his mentorship and backing over the
years, to our
Board members for their guidance, and to all our
customers
for the confidence they reposed in us. I take this
opportunity
to thank all my colleagues whose support and trust
made
my journey as CEO successful, satisfying and
unforgettable. I
also thank all my fellow TCSers whose energy,
dedication and
aspirations continue to power the organization’s
success.
I have had the pleasure of interacting with some of
you in
person over the last decade. Your feedback and
insights helped
me learn and shaped my worldview. Thank you for all
your
support and encouragement.
With enterprises relying on technology ever more to
drive their
competitive differentiation, technology intensity is
rising and
on a secular basis, the share of IT services within
overall tech
spending is also going up. I am confident that TCS’
best years are
ahead, and I look forward to watching the company’s
continued
success from outside.
Best Regards,
Rajesh Gopinathan
Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director
(For FY 2022-23)
Our employee volunteer program called HOPE (Hours of
Purpose
by Employees) resulted in over 2.8 million hours of
volunteering
effort towards promoting issues most relevant in
their local
communities, such as mental health, climate action,
circularity,
education, skilling, mentoring, and conservation.
On the environmental front, we continue to make good
progress
in our net zero journey. We have brought down our
absolute
carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions
by 71%
over base year 2016, meeting our target two years
ahead of
time. This was despite increased electricity
consumption in FY
2023 from employees’ return to office. In addition to
enterprise-
wide initiatives for energy efficiency, we have also
significantly
increased our use of renewable energy. Renewable
energy
sources today make up 55% of the total (7.25% in
2016).
